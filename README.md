# market-anomaly-agent

This project is an intelligent market monitoring system that captures unusual stock movement news in real time and leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to orchestrate large language models for structured analysis and signal interpretation.

It ingests financial news related to abnormal price or volume movements, applies LLM-powered parsing to extract key entities and events, and transforms unstructured content into actionable insights. By combining automated data collection, MCP-based tool integration, and AI-driven reasoning, the system enables scalable, extensible, and explainable analysis of market-moving information for research and quantitative workflows.
